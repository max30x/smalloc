## smalloc 

### description
----
smalloc is a simple self-using memory allocator.It's some kind of easy to use.
Actually,this can also be called tmalloc.But since 't' and 's' mean the same thing to me,so smalloc.
What can it do ? This is a good question because I don't know that neither.It's up to you.In fact,
it's still under development (v0.1).So it's no surprise that it only has some basic function now.

### steps & objects
----
- [x] some utility functions
- [x] arena
- [x] thread cache
- [ ] interface
